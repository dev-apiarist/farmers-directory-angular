          We are a registry company operating locally in Jamaica,<br />We are
          committed to helping our users create a avenue to sell their produce
          to local business.<br />
          Our users ranged from small farmers to plantations owners, and the
          target businesses range from individual buyers, small and medium size
          companies, large corporation, and investors.

      <p>
        The Farmer Director was founded in 2022 by a group of engineers who have
        came to the realization that there wasn’t a platform to support our
        local farmers. Wanted to create a solution for this, they came together
        as a team to fix the issue. After much debate, the team came to the
        conclusion to make a register where users (farmer) can register and list
        their produce, and potential buyers can browse for the produce they
        need.
